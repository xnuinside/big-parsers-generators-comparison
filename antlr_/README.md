# ANTLR parser README.md

First, we need to define a grammar file in ANTLR syntax. 

In our case it is a `example.g4` file.

To generate the lexer, parser and visitor classes from the ANTLR grammar, you need to follow these steps:

Install ANTLR: You can install ANTLR using a package manager like Homebrew or by downloading it from the ANTLR website.

Write the grammar: Write the ANTLR grammar for your parser in a .g4 file.

Generate the lexer and parser classes: Use the ANTLR tool to generate the lexer and parser classes from the grammar. The command to generate the classes is as follows:

Copy code
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 example.g4
This will generate the lexer, parser, and visitor classes in Python 3 for the grammar defined in example.g4. Note that you need to replace example.g4 with the name of your grammar file.

After generating the lexer, parser, and visitor classes, you can use them in your Python code to parse input strings.
